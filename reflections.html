									<p>Take a look at some of the great things the OpenEHR Community has accomplished! What am I missing?</p>
									<h1>The Fellowship</h1>
										<p>Coming into this fellowship, I was driven by a desire to deepen my experience in clinical modelling — an area where learning opportunities are often limited in my local context. Despite a growing interest in openEHR and even a national push toward implementing a clinical data repository (CDR), hands-on modelling experience has remained elusive. The local community is still small, and structured mentorship or active modelling projects are rare.<br>

										To bridge that gap, I’ve made it a priority to join modelling meetings. Just being in the meeting, listening to the way experienced modelers think through structures and constraints, has been invaluable. These sessions have given me a much-needed practical feel for the work — a perspective that documentation can’t fully provide.</p>

									<h1>The Past, Present and Futrue </h1>

										<p>Throughout the last fellowship meeting, the thought came to me that the concept of an electronic health record (EHR) means something different to every country on their continuum of development. I have witnessed the excitement displayed when a new proprietary standalone electronic health record is introduced in any aspect of service delivery in my country, and I understand, it is progress of a sort. But, the concept of a lifelong care record unrestricted by data formats or vendor restrictions is still something of a novel concept amongst healthcare professionals.<br>

										The shift in ideologies is never instantaneous but gradual. Both the 25-Year retrospective of the Catalonia Region or the rapid implementation of the London’s shared care planning highlight that innovation is a continuous and evolving process. And yet these EHRs that many countries have spent decades building, the vision of a shared data ecosystem, is just the tip of the iceberg. Unified Digital Health Platforms (UDHPs) represents what many hailed as the future of health data innovation; that provide a citizen-focused health record system that integrates healthcare data, improve usability, and support new digital tools.</p>

									<h1>My Project </h1>

										<p>My fellowship project focuses on antenatal care — one of the first clinical models we envisioned when openEHR was introduced in Jamaica years ago. My recent work over the past year on maternal mortality reignited my passion to revisit and complete this initiative. It feels both necessary and personal.<br>

										One of the key resources in this project is the WHO Antenatal Care Digital Adaptation Kit (DAK). The DAK provides structured workflows, decision support logic, and data elements that align with global clinical guidelines. In addition this project will assist in the realignment, optimisation and digitisation of Jamaica’s antenatal care record. The DAK is an essential reference as I begin translating guideline-based content into openEHR archetypes and templates. The process of aligning WHO recommendations with openEHR’s modelling framework has deepened my appreciation for the precision and nuance required in semantic modelling and how much work goes into turning paper-based guidance into computable, interoperable health content.<br>

										Looking ahead, I hope to deepen my technical confidence and contribute something sustainable to the family health programme in Jamaica. The work is far from easy, but it feels timely and worthwhile — and I'm grateful to be on this path.</p>
